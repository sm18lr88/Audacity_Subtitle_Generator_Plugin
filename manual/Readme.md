## What is this?

The programming language of my plugin doesn't work with non-standard characters or languages like Finnish.

These files at least allow the conversion of an exported label text file into .srt

## Usage

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
If you have python installed:
  ```bash
  python label-to-srt.py C:\path\to\file.txt
  ```
If you don't have python, use the .exe:
  ```bash
  label-to-srt.exe C:\path\to\file.txt
  ```

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - Simply run the script without any arguments:
    ```bash
    python label-to-srt.py
    ```
  - Or double-click the executable and use its graphical user interface.
